# Default to Python

* **Status:** approved
* **Last Updated:** 2021-03
* **Objective:** Set a default programming language for backend work.

## Context & Problem Statement

We need to build a fairly robust demo application in order to showcase technical concepts. We need a programming language that many potential contributors will know and that many users would feel comfortable reading if they choose to deep dive.

## Priorities & Constraints <!-- optional -->

* The starting team's most common languages are Python and Node.js.

## Considered Options

* Option 1: Python
* Option 2: Node.js
* Option 3: Java
* Option 4: Go

## Decision

Chosen option: Python. This was the strongest language of the three initial core contributors, and is understood by many Googlers and Google Cloud developers.

### Expected Consequences <!-- optional -->

Many application developers do not use Python, and may be uncomfortable learning application details in Python
