* **Status:** superceded by [2022-02-revisting-js-framework decision](2022-02-revisting-js-framework decision.md)
* **Last Updated:** 2021-03
* **Objective:** Deliberate frontend strategy by a mostly full-stack/backend team.

## Context & Problem Statement

Frontend frameworks can provide a lot of power, but add complexity. Emblem might eventually want a sophisticated frontend, but we have simple starting goals.

## Priorities & Constraints <!-- optional -->

* Team is mostly backend

## Considered Options

* Option 1: JavaScript + libraries
* Option 2: A rich framework such as Angular, React, or Vue

## Decision

Chose Option 1 to keep the frontend implementation approachable to backend developers as both contributors and learners.

### Expected Consequences <!-- optional -->

* This demo will be less effective at engaging with frontend engineers
* This decision has a high likelihood of being deprecated if the project is successful
