# Emblem REST Api Server

This folder contains the software for the Emblem REST API.

The [OpenAPI specification of this API](./openapi.yaml) defines
the operations and data for this API.

Most application developers should use the (Client Libraries)[../client-lib]
instead of directly sending requests to the API itself.

See the [TESTING](./TESTING.md) and (INSTALLING)[./INSTALLING.md]
for instructions to deploy the server to Google Cloud.
