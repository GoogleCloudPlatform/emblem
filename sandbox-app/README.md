# Emblem Giving: Frontend App


Note: This is just a prototype only. Leveraging same api url, but also 
using existing flask app as a proxy api to the react app for the sake of quick prototyping.


## Start flask 
* `cd website/ & pip3 install  -r requirements.txt`
* `flask run`
* Should see it running on `http://127.0.0.1:5000`

## Running the sandbox app

* `npm run install` 
* `npm run build`
* `npm run start`
* Open your browser window to `localhost:8080`
