# NOTE: Playwright NPM packages ***CAN NOT*** be installed here,
# and must be installed within Cloud Build itself. This is because:
# 1) Those packages are listed in `package.json`
# 2) Thus, `npm` insists that they are installed locally.
# 3) Cloud Build overwrites local packages upon `git clone`-ing.

# Alias "python" to "python3"
RUN ln -s /usr/bin/python3 /usr/bin/python
