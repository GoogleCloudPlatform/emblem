## Requirements

Please have [node](https://nodejs.org/en/ ) 14 & npm 8 or higher installed.

## Get started

Within your terminal, open one tab to run the proxy and another to run the app.

```bash
npm install
npm build 
npm run dev
```

- `server` runs the proxy server to target api on port `3000`
- `start` runs your app for development on port `8000`, reloading on file changes
- `dev` uses npm-run-all to run the above `server` and `start` scripts in parallel (Perfect for cloudshell development.)
