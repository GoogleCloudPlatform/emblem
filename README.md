# Emblem Giving: A Sample Application

> This sample application is only for learning purposes.

Emblem Giving demonstrates a complex, end-to-end serverless architecture. It showcases continuous delivery and trouble recovery wrapped up in a donation sample app.

Real financial transactions are not made. The giving campaigns in the app
are not real.
